  Scenario: Create aircraft with correct data
    Given I use seed data
    When I send a "DELETE" request to "/api/v1/aircraft/9f5da1a4-f09e-4961-8299-82d688337d1f"
    Then the response status should be 204
    When I send a "GET" request to "/api/v1/aircraft/9f5da1a4-f09e-4961-8299-82d688337d1f"
    Then the response status should be 404
    And the response body should contain:
    """json
    {
      "message": "Aircraft with given id does not exist.",
      "error": "Not Found",
      "statusCode": 404
    }
    """
